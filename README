Hello!

I learned about conditionals in JavaScript and enjoyed working on the Magic Eight Ball project on Codecademy. I decided to use the same concept to create a random tarot draw from the major arcana. This project was also a great opportunity to put HTML, CSS and JS together for the first time.

I found it tricky to figure out how to link an external JS file to a html file, but I got there in the end – after a bit of trial and error! I'd love to include pictures of the tarot cards and have left a part of the code commented out to accommodate this at a later date (when I figure out how to do it!).
